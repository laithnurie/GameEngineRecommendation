# Game Engine recommendation
Goal is to return a list of recommendations based on a selected game id

Please check games.csv file, this is the raw csv file from database

Currently I am brute forcing the recommendation engines in a high computational manner, instead I want to use Content-Based Recommendation Algorithm.

Currently I am able to get the recommendations.json using game id of 1942

We will measure success by getting similar results using that id (we will test with multiple ids to confirm that it will work)
